Jane knocked on Susan's door but she did not answer.,Susan did not answer.,1 (entailment),Jane knocked on Susan's door but Susan did not answer.,"Susan was not at home.  

(Explanation: The label ""entailment"" means that SENTENCE 2 logically follows from SENTENCE 1. If Jane knocked on Susan's door and she did not answer, it is reasonable to infer that Susan was not at home.)",0.18,0.53,0.53,0.57,No
"The lawyer asked the witness a question, but he was reluctant to repeat it.",The lawyer was reluctant to repeat it.,1 (entailment),"The lawyer asked the witness a question, but the witness was reluctant to repeat it.","The witness hesitated to answer the lawyer's question.  

**Explanation:** The label ""1 (entailment)"" indicates that SENTENCE 2 logically follows from SENTENCE 1. In SENTENCE 1, the witness is described as reluctant to repeat the question, which implies hesitation in responding. SENTENCE 2 captures this hesitation, maintaining the logical relationship.",0.18,0.64,0.53,0.67,No
The delivery truck zoomed by the school bus because it was going so slow.,The school bus was going so slow.,1 (entailment),The school bus was going so slow.,"The delivery truck was moving faster than the school bus.  

Explanation: The label ""1 (entailment)"" indicates that SENTENCE 2 must logically follow from SENTENCE 1. Since SENTENCE 1 states that the delivery truck zoomed by the school bus because it was going slow, it implies that the delivery truck was moving faster than the school bus.",0.19,1.0,0.48,0.97,Yes (exact match)
"The cat was lying by the mouse hole waiting for the mouse, but it was too cautious.",The mouse was too cautious.,1 (entailment),"The cat was waiting for the mouse by the mouse hole, but the mouse was too cautious.","The cat did not catch the mouse because it was too cautious.  

**Explanation:** The label ""1 (entailment)"" indicates that SENTENCE 2 logically follows from SENTENCE 1. Since the cat was too cautious, it is reasonable to infer that it did not catch the mouse, which aligns with the entailment relationship.",0.18,0.45,0.57,0.47,No
"The dog chased the cat, which ran up a tree. It waited at the top.",The cat waited at the top.,1 (entailment),The dog waited at the top of the tree.,"The cat escaped from the dog by climbing the tree.  

Explanation: SENTENCE 2 logically follows from SENTENCE 1 because it describes the cat's action of climbing the tree as a means of escaping the dog, which is consistent with the events described in SENTENCE 1. This relationship is labeled as entailment (1).",0.1,0.67,0.47,0.6,No
"Susan knew that Ann's son had been in a car accident, so she told her about it.",Ann told her about it.,0 (not entailment),Susan told Ann about the car accident.,"Susan informed Ann that her son had been in a car accident.  

Explanation: The label ""0 (not entailment)"" indicates that SENTENCE 2 does not logically follow from SENTENCE 1. While SENTENCE 1 states that Susan told Ann about the accident, SENTENCE 2 rephrases the same information without introducing any new logical implications or contradictions, thus maintaining the ""not entailment"" relationship.",0.09,0.33,0.51,0.54,No
The large ball crashed right through the table because it was made of styrofoam.,The large ball was made of styrofoam.,0 (not entailment),The table was made of styrofoam.,"The table was not strong enough to withstand the impact of the large ball.  

**Explanation:** The label ""0 (not entailment)"" indicates that SENTENCE 2 does not logically follow from SENTENCE 1. While SENTENCE 1 explains that the table was made of styrofoam, SENTENCE 2 introduces a different idea about the table's strength, which is not directly entailed by the material alone.",0.2,0.77,0.51,0.51,No
"The older students were bullying the younger ones, so we rescued them.",We rescued the older students.,0 (not entailment),"The older students were bullying the younger ones, so we rescued the older students.","The older students continued to bully the younger ones despite our efforts to intervene.  

(Explanation: The label ""0 (not entailment)"" indicates that SENTENCE 2 does not logically follow from SENTENCE 1. In this case, SENTENCE 1 suggests that the younger students were rescued, while SENTENCE 2 contradicts this by stating that the bullying persisted.)",0.1,0.53,0.43,0.63,No
Sam's drawing was hung just above Tina's and it did look much better with another one below it.,Tina's drawing did look much better with another one below it.,0 (not entailment),Sam's drawing was hung just above Tina's and it did look much better with another one below it.,"Sam's drawing was not hung above Tina's, and it did not look better with another one below it.  

**Explanation:** The label ""0 (not entailment)"" indicates that SENTENCE 2 should not logically follow from SENTENCE 1. By negating the key details in SENTENCE 1, SENTENCE 2 contradicts it, ensuring there is no entailment.",0.3,0.69,0.46,0.69,No
"George got free tickets to the play, but he gave them to Eric, because he was not particularly eager to see it.",Eric was not particularly eager to see it.,0 (not entailment),George was not particularly eager to see the play.,"George decided to keep the tickets for himself and attended the play. 

(Explanation: The label ""0"" indicates that SENTENCE 2 does not logically follow from SENTENCE 1. In SENTENCE 1, George gave the tickets to Eric because he wasn't eager to see the play, so SENTENCE 2 contradicts this by stating he kept the tickets and attended, which is not entailed by the first sentence.)",0.11,0.71,0.6,0.64,No

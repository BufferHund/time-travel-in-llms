I can't cut that tree down with that axe; it is too small.,The axe is too small.,1 (entailment),"SENTENCE 2:  
The axe is too small to cut down the tree.","The axe is not large enough to cut down the tree.  

(Explanation: SENTENCE 2 logically follows from SENTENCE 1 because if the axe is too small to cut the tree, it implies that the axe is not large enough for the task, which is an entailment relationship.)",0.19,0.59,0.57,0.6,No
Fred watched TV while George went out to buy groceries. After an hour he got back.,George got back.,1 (entailment),"SENTENCE 2:  
George went out to buy groceries and got back after an hour.","SENTENCE 2: George returned home after buying groceries.  

Explanation: The label ""1 (entailment)"" indicates that SENTENCE 2 must logically follow from SENTENCE 1. Since SENTENCE 1 states that George went out to buy groceries and returned after an hour, SENTENCE 2 correctly concludes that George came back home after completing his task.",0.07,0.35,0.5,0.44,No
Joe has sold his house and bought a new one a few miles away. He will be moving out of it on Thursday.,He will be moving out of The old house on Thursday.,1 (entailment),Joe will be moving out of his house on Thursday.,"Joe will no longer live in his old house after Thursday.  

(Explanation: SENTENCE 2 logically follows from SENTENCE 1 because if Joe is moving out of his old house on Thursday, it means he will no longer live there after that day. This is an example of entailment, where SENTENCE 2 is a necessary consequence of SENTENCE 1.)",0.23,0.76,0.62,0.73,No
"When Tatyana reached the cabin, her mother was sleeping. She was careful not to disturb her, undressing and climbing back into her berth.","Tatyana was careful not to disturb her, undressing and climbing back into her berth.",1 (entailment),"Tatyana was careful not to disturb her mother, undressing and climbing back into her berth.","Tatyana's mother was asleep when Tatyana returned to the cabin.  

(Explanation: SENTENCE 2 logically follows from SENTENCE 1, as it restates the information that Tatyana's mother was sleeping when Tatyana arrived, which aligns with the entailment label.)",0.11,0.97,0.44,0.86,No
Carol believed that Rebecca regretted that she had stolen the watch.,Carol believed that Rebecca regretted that Rebecca had stolen the watch.,1 (entailment),"SENTENCE 2:
Rebecca regretted that she had stolen the watch.","SENTENCE 2: Rebecca had stolen the watch, and Carol thought that Rebecca felt remorse for her actions.  

Explanation: The label ""1 (entailment)"" indicates that SENTENCE 2 must logically follow from SENTENCE 1. SENTENCE 1 states that Carol believed Rebecca regretted stealing the watch, which implies that Rebecca did steal the watch and that Carol thought Rebecca felt remorse. SENTENCE 2 captures this by directly stating that Rebecca stole the watch and that Carol believed Rebecca felt remorse, thus maintaining the entailment relationship.",0.17,0.67,0.6,0.62,No
James asked Robert for a favor but he was refused.,Robert was refused.,0 (not entailment),"SENTENCE 2:  
Robert refused to do the favor for James.","SENTENCE 2: Robert agreed to help James with the favor.

Explanation: The label ""0 (not entailment)"" indicates that SENTENCE 2 should not logically follow from SENTENCE 1. Since SENTENCE 1 states that Robert refused to do the favor, SENTENCE 2 contradicts this by stating that Robert agreed to help, which aligns with the label.",0.07,0.31,0.45,0.43,No
The foxes are getting in at night and attacking the chickens. I shall have to kill them.,I shall have to kill The chickens.,0 (not entailment),"SENTENCE 2:  
The foxes are attacking the chickens.  

(Note: The label ""0"" indicates that SENTENCE 1 does not entail SENTENCE 2, as SENTENCE 1 implies the speaker will kill the foxes, which is not mentioned or implied in SENTENCE 2.)","SENTENCE 2: The foxes are harmless and only visit the farm to play with the chickens.

Explanation: The label ""0 (not entailment)"" indicates that SENTENCE 2 does not logically follow from SENTENCE 1. In SENTENCE 1, the speaker expresses concern about foxes attacking chickens and plans to kill them, while SENTENCE 2 contradicts this by stating that the foxes are harmless and only visit to play, which is not consistent with the original statement.",0.07,0.09,0.47,0.43,No
"Jackson was greatly influenced by Arnold, though he lived two centuries later.",Arnold lived two centuries later.,0 (not entailment),Jackson lived two centuries after Arnold.,"SENTENCE 2: Jackson and Arnold lived in the same time period and collaborated on many projects.

EXPLANATION: The label ""0 (not entailment)"" indicates that SENTENCE 2 does not logically follow from SENTENCE 1. SENTENCE 1 states that Jackson lived two centuries after Arnold, which contradicts the idea in SENTENCE 2 that they lived in the same time period and collaborated. Therefore, SENTENCE 2 is not entailed by SENTENCE 1.",0.11,0.55,0.51,0.54,No
"The dog chased the cat, which ran up a tree. It waited at the bottom.",The cat waited at the bottom.,0 (not entailment),"SENTENCE 2:
The dog waited at the bottom of the tree.

LABEL: 0 (not entailment)","SENTENCE 2: The dog eventually gave up and walked away, leaving the cat still in the tree.

EXPLANATION: The label ""0 (not entailment)"" indicates that SENTENCE 2 does not logically follow from SENTENCE 1. In SENTENCE 1, the dog is waiting at the bottom of the tree, but there is no information suggesting that the dog gave up or left. Therefore, SENTENCE 2 introduces new information that is not supported by SENTENCE 1, making the relationship between the two sentences non-entailment.",0.11,0.48,0.54,0.37,No
"The signs over the shops' doors had pictures that indicated what work was done inside. Although more and more people were learning how to read, each artisan still had signs, not wishing to lose a possible patron merely because he happened to be illiterate.","Each artisan still had signs, not wishing to lose a possible patron merely because the artisan happened to be illiterate.",0 (not entailment),"SENTENCE 2:  
Each artisan still had signs, not wishing to lose a possible patron merely because he happened to be illiterate.  

This matches the instance in the WNLI dataset.","SENTENCE 2: The artisans continued to use pictorial signs because they believed that relying solely on written signs would exclude potential customers who could not read.

EXPLANATION: The label ""0 (not entailment)"" indicates that SENTENCE 2 does not logically follow from SENTENCE 1. While SENTENCE 1 explains that artisans used pictorial signs to avoid losing illiterate customers, SENTENCE 2 introduces a new ideaâ€”that artisans believed written signs would exclude illiterate customers. This is not directly stated or implied in SENTENCE 1, making the relationship between the two sentences non-entailment.",0.09,0.73,0.56,0.71,No

I can't cut that tree down with that axe; it is too small.,The axe is too small.,1 (entailment),The axe is too small to cut down the tree.,"The axe is not large enough to cut down the tree.  

(Explanation: SENTENCE 2 logically follows from SENTENCE 1 because if the axe is too small to cut the tree, it implies that the axe is not large enough for the task, which is an entailment relationship.)",0.19,0.67,0.57,0.64,No
Fred watched TV while George went out to buy groceries. After an hour he got back.,George got back.,1 (entailment),George went out to buy groceries and returned after an hour.,"George returned home after purchasing groceries.  

**Explanation:** The label ""1 (entailment)"" indicates that SENTENCE 2 logically follows from SENTENCE 1. Since SENTENCE 1 states that George went out to buy groceries and returned after an hour, SENTENCE 2 correctly concludes that George came back home after completing his task.",0.08,0.14,0.53,0.5,No
Joe has sold his house and bought a new one a few miles away. He will be moving out of it on Thursday.,He will be moving out of The old house on Thursday.,1 (entailment),Joe will be moving out of his house on Thursday.,"Joe will no longer be living in his current house after Thursday.  

(Explanation: SENTENCE 2 logically follows from SENTENCE 1 because if Joe is moving out of his current house on Thursday, it means he will no longer be living there after that day. This aligns with the entailment label, where SENTENCE 2 is a direct consequence of SENTENCE 1.)",0.23,0.76,0.63,0.73,No
"When Tatyana reached the cabin, her mother was sleeping. She was careful not to disturb her, undressing and climbing back into her berth.","Tatyana was careful not to disturb her, undressing and climbing back into her berth.",1 (entailment),Tatyana was careful not to disturb her mother when she returned to the cabin.,"Tatyana quietly returned to her berth without waking her mother.  

(Explanation: SENTENCE 2 logically follows from SENTENCE 1, as it directly supports the idea that Tatyana was careful not to disturb her sleeping mother, which is consistent with the entailment label.)",0.25,0.5,0.56,0.63,No
Carol believed that Rebecca regretted that she had stolen the watch.,Carol believed that Rebecca regretted that Rebecca had stolen the watch.,1 (entailment),Rebecca had stolen the watch.,"Carol believed that Rebecca felt remorse for taking the watch.  

Explanation: The label ""entailment"" indicates that SENTENCE 2 must logically follow from SENTENCE 1. In this case, SENTENCE 2 rephrases SENTENCE 1 by expressing the same idea—that Carol believed Rebecca felt regret or remorse for stealing the watch—thus maintaining the logical relationship.",0.25,0.62,0.52,0.45,No
James asked Robert for a favor but he was refused.,Robert was refused.,0 (not entailment),James refused to do the favor for Robert.,"James did not receive the favor he requested from Robert.  

Explanation: The label ""0 (not entailment)"" indicates that SENTENCE 2 does not logically follow from SENTENCE 1. While SENTENCE 1 states that James was refused a favor, SENTENCE 2 introduces the idea that James did not receive the favor, which is a slightly different interpretation and not a direct entailment.",0.1,0.18,0.52,0.42,No
The foxes are getting in at night and attacking the chickens. I shall have to kill them.,I shall have to kill The chickens.,0 (not entailment),"The foxes are attacking the chickens, so I will have to kill the foxes.","The foxes are harmless and pose no threat to the chickens.  

(Explanation: The label ""0"" indicates that SENTENCE 2 does not entail SENTENCE 1. In this case, SENTENCE 2 contradicts SENTENCE 1 by stating that the foxes are harmless, which means the conclusion in SENTENCE 1 about needing to kill them does not logically follow.)",0.1,0.48,0.51,0.65,No
"Jackson was greatly influenced by Arnold, though he lived two centuries later.",Arnold lived two centuries later.,0 (not entailment),Jackson lived two centuries after Arnold.,"Jackson lived in a different era than Arnold, but his work still reflected Arnold's impact.  

(Explanation: The label ""0 (not entailment)"" means that SENTENCE 2 does not logically follow from SENTENCE 1. While SENTENCE 1 states that Jackson was influenced by Arnold despite the time gap, SENTENCE 2 introduces the idea that Jackson's work reflected Arnold's impact, which is not explicitly stated or entailed by SENTENCE 1.)",0.03,0.55,0.52,0.54,No
"The dog chased the cat, which ran up a tree. It waited at the bottom.",The cat waited at the bottom.,0 (not entailment),The dog waited at the bottom of the tree.,"The dog eventually gave up and walked away, leaving the cat safely in the tree.  

Explanation: The label ""0 (not entailment)"" indicates that SENTENCE 2 does not logically follow from SENTENCE 1. While SENTENCE 1 describes the dog waiting at the bottom of the tree, SENTENCE 2 introduces new information (the dog giving up and walking away) that is not implied or supported by SENTENCE 1.",0.14,0.67,0.55,0.59,No
"The signs over the shops' doors had pictures that indicated what work was done inside. Although more and more people were learning how to read, each artisan still had signs, not wishing to lose a possible patron merely because he happened to be illiterate.","Each artisan still had signs, not wishing to lose a possible patron merely because the artisan happened to be illiterate.",0 (not entailment),The artisans had signs over their shops' doors to attract customers who could not read.,"The signs over the shops' doors were purely decorative and served no practical purpose in identifying the type of work done inside.  

(Explanation: SENTENCE 2 contradicts SENTENCE 1, as SENTENCE 1 states that the signs indicated the work done inside, while SENTENCE 2 claims they were purely decorative. This aligns with the label ""0 (not entailment)"" since SENTENCE 2 does not logically follow from SENTENCE 1.)",0.05,0.17,0.39,0.57,No

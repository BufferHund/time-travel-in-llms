"I was looking to get out of the apartment on a really nice, sunny day and we decided to drive to Waterfront and walk around. All around great day until we hit Bar Louie for some drinks and appetizers. I am giving it one star, though it deserves none, because our waitress was nice, if a bit inattentive, and the hummus app we ordered was pretty damn good. Outside of that Bar Louie leaves a lot to be desired. This is probably the first place I've been to where they charge $10 and up for all mixed drinks. To me, that is beyond ridiculous. Bar Louie is not an upscale restaurant, as much as they wish they were, and paying almost $60 for three drinks and two appetizers is insanity defined. As I mentioned the waitress was friendly, but she definitely did not come back and check on us enough. I really wanted to like this place because of things I had heard and the drinks we had were really damn good, but if it want to spend that kind of money, I'll go somewhere that I can get good service.",0 (1 star),"I was looking to get out of the apartment on a really nice, sunny day and we decided to drive to Waterfront and walk around.

"I was quoted a price for a new pair of glasses and lenses that were in the 50% area. Came back the next day excited to buy the glasses and was told the glasses were not on sale for 50% and that the quote someone gave me the day before was wrong.

Awful place. If you are trying to go there for good drinks this is an OK place to go to but the food was horrible. The tapas ceviche was $10 which came with 4 shrimp and was topped with popcorn (I have no idea why). If they were trying to go for fun and innovative food this place completely missed the mark. The potatoes and chorizo came in an extremely small portions and where bland. Not to mention the paella which was $25 and the rice was not well cooked. This place takes small portions to a new level.

"What to do on Christmas Eve eve... oh, Carolina Place Mall is open 'til 11pm? Let's go wander around there and watch the masses scramble for gifts. When I need to make a mall trip, this is not at the top of the list for me. I rank Northlake, SouthPark and Concord all above it. One: anything that involves 485 does not make me pleasant.

That being said, it's not all bad. The food court has a decent variety, and the movie theater is a nice addition. The mall is clean and well-maintained, and the staff is generally friendly. It's just not my first choice when I have other options. If you're in the area and need to do some last-minute shopping, it'll do the job, but don't expect anything extraordinary.","But hey, it’s Christmas Eve eve, and sometimes you just have to embrace the chaos. The mall is decked out in twinkling lights, and the holiday music is blaring—it’s hard not to feel a little festive, even if you’re just there to people-watch. Sure, the store selection might not be the best, but there’s something oddly satisfying about seeing last-minute shoppers darting from store to store, clutching their lists like lifelines. Plus, the food court is always a solid option for a quick snack or a caffeine boost to keep the energy up. And who knows? Maybe you’ll stumble upon a hidden gem in one of those “meh” stores. It’s not my first choice, but for a dose of holiday madness, Carolina Place Mall will do just fine.",0.13,0.13,0.59,0.59,No
Upstream is probably thought of as one of the best restaurants in Charlotte. I am from Philadelphia where there are excellent restaurants with iron chefs so my viewpoint may be a bit skewed. The food was good but not great or amazing. Every dish (except the house salad) was over salted. My husband had the tuna and I had the seabass. They were both very good but as I said before not great. We would go there again but for sushi/raw items not necessarily the cooked menu items.

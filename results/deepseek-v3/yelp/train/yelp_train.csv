"Three strikes and you're out! We had brunch there a few months back, and the meal was so salty that we could barely begin to eat it. That meal was comped and I figured it was an off day. We went back about a month later for dinner, and that meal was also very salty and we could not finish it. We were willing to try again, so we went for dinner tonight. I ordered the filet, and it was like eating a salt shaker. I was shocked that, for a third time, I had a piss poor meal at Casbah. I sent that back, and ordered the sea bass. When I got to the end of the piece of fish, it was raw. Needless to say, I will NEVER return to this restaurant. Looking back, what should I have expected from the sister restaurant of Mad Mex?",0 (1 star),"Three strikes and you're out!

We waited over 30 minutes for our entrees, and when they finally arrived, they were barely warm. The server seemed disinterested and didn’t check on us until we were nearly done. We won’t be returning.","Unfortunately, the third time was not the charm. Once again, the food was overwhelmingly salty, making it nearly inedible. We tried to give the benefit of the doubt after the first two experiences, but this consistent issue is clearly not a fluke. The service was also lackluster, with our server seeming disinterested and inattentive. At this point, it’s clear that this restaurant has serious quality control problems, and we won’t be returning. It’s disappointing to have such a consistently poor experience, especially when we were hoping for improvement. Save yourself the trouble and skip this place.",0.15,0.11,0.56,0.54,No
"I have been in this bar many times with a friend of mine (who has been a patron for decades) and I thought the owners were really nice people but now I wonder. My friend is now confined to a wheelchair and still likes to frequent this bar, however, there are a couple of steps that lead into the back rooms where there are pool tables, dart boards, etc. She cannot get to this area and has a ramp that she would give to the owners so she can access this area. They refuse to put in the ramp. I thought all public businesses had to comply with the Americans With Disabilities Act as long as it does not create an undue hardship. Tell me, how is putting down a ramp that is given to you for free a hardship!

"I have been a customer of the Triangle Bar & Grill for over twenty five years. They have the BEST subs ever. BUT on this trip I was buying several to share with people from out of town. They are cash only and more than happy to show you an ATM that charges you $2.50 per transaction. The employees don't set the rules but have to live with them. That $2.50 came out of their tip, they can hit up their boss for the rest. Its 2014 and they still don't take credit and or debit cards.

"Not exactly a fan of this location, however I tend to frequent it because of my work location, but I always leave unsatisfied. The baristas are not friendly. I'm always always always made to feel like I'm stupid (seriously? i'm ordering coffee from you - who gave you a Masters Degree of all things brewed?) and they're just rude. Just.... rude. I've never had an issue with my order being accurate, although again, just ordering coffee people. I'm not asking you to recite the Gettysburg address.. in Latin.. backwards. Just asking for a coffee.. congrats on getting it right! I wwill also add that everytime I go in to this store, it smells.. bad. real bad. not like the delicious aroma of fresh brewed coffee. No no. You know those febreze commercials where they take the most disgusting atmosphere for smell and throw poor, unsuspecting victims in there to test the febreze-ee-ness of the area? Yeah, it's like that. Only with no febreze. To sum it up, I would suggest if you're in the area and need some starbucks in your life, take a few extra steps and go to the one on the corner of 6th and penn. Those people are SUPER friendly (gave me a free coffee on new years day because I was on my way to work and realized I forgot my credit card after I ordered for me and my coworkers.. so nice!) and it smells like a coffee shop should smell - like coffee.

I’ve tried to give this place multiple chances, but it consistently falls short. I’m not sure if it’s a management issue or just the staff, but something needs to change. For now, I’ll continue to go because of convenience, but I’ll be looking for a better coffee spot in the area.","The seating area is equally disappointing. The chairs are uncomfortable, and the tables are often sticky, as if they haven’t been wiped down properly in days. The ambiance is far from inviting—harsh lighting and a lack of music or any kind of background noise make the space feel sterile and unwelcoming. I’ve tried to sit and work here a few times, but it’s impossible to focus or relax. The Wi-Fi is spotty at best, and the outlets are few and far between, which is frustrating when you’re trying to get some work done.  

To make matters worse, the prices are higher than other coffee shops in the area, and the quality just doesn’t justify the cost. I’ve given this place multiple chances, hoping it might improve, but it’s consistently underwhelming. Honestly, the only reason I keep coming back is because it’s the closest option to my workplace. If there were any other decent coffee shop nearby, I’d be there instead. This place gets 2 stars solely because they manage to get my order right, but that’s about the only positive thing I can say.",0.13,0.15,0.71,0.72,No
"I love the concept but I think it is overrated. I have been hearing so much hype about Primanti Brothers that I was so excited to finally get to stop in at one. I have no problem with the size or amount of grease, I just don't get the greatness of the sandwiches. We ordered the Kolbassi & Cheese and the Pitts-burger cheesesteak (#2 best seller). I had half of each one along with cheese fries. I thought both sandwiches were a little dry especially the cheesesteak. The coleslaw seemed to be too dry for my taste or maybe it was the abundance of fries that dried everything out for me. I am not a big fry fan in the first place. I would like to see some other options for bread like a wheat or whole grain option. I would also recommend putting extra cheese on the sandwich as I couldn't even taste cheese. I like cheese and they need more to help balance the dryness. Service was a little lame as I barely could understand our ""too cool"" server. He seemed disinterested in us for the most part. The pregnant waitress who helped us out once seemed more congenial and helpful. I like the fact that it is small and fast. I just don't get the vast appeal.

The service was friendly and prompt, which made the experience more enjoyable. However, the food didn’t quite live up to the hype for me. While the portions were generous, the flavors felt one-dimensional. The Kolbassi & Cheese had potential, but the dryness of the bread and coleslaw made it hard to fully enjoy. The Pitts-burger cheesesteak was underwhelming, lacking the juiciness and depth of flavor I expected from a bestseller. The cheese fries were decent, but again, nothing extraordinary. I think with a few tweaks—like moister coleslaw, better bread options, and more flavorful cheese—the sandwiches could be much better.

I like the variety of soups; however, if you want mac and cheese, come early because they always run out of it. The tuscan bean is good, as is the tomato bisque.

It's great for groups....which is quite obvious since there are always several folks there for bachelorette parties and birthdays.

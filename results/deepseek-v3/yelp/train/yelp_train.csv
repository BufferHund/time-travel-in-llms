"Three strikes and you're out! We had brunch there a few months back, and the meal was so salty that we could barely begin to eat it. That meal was comped and I figured it was an off day. We went back about a month later for dinner, and that meal was also very salty and we could not finish it. We were willing to try again, so we went for dinner tonight. I ordered the filet, and it was like eating a salt shaker. I was shocked that, for a third time, I had a piss poor meal at Casbah. I sent that back, and ordered the sea bass. When I got to the end of the piece of fish, it was raw. Needless to say, I will NEVER return to this restaurant. Looking back, what should I have expected from the sister restaurant of Mad Mex?",0 (1 star),"Three strikes and you're out!

The food was once again overly salty, and the service was slow and inattentive. We waited over 30 minutes for our entrees, and when they finally arrived, they were cold. The manager did not seem to care about our complaints and offered no resolution. We will not be returning.","Unfortunately, the third time was not the charm. Once again, the food was overwhelmingly salty, making it nearly inedible. Despite our hopes that the previous experiences were just flukes, it seems this is a consistent issue with their kitchen. The service was polite, but that doesn’t make up for the fact that we couldn’t enjoy our meal. We’ve given this place three chances, and each time has been a disappointment. We won’t be returning, and I wouldn’t recommend it to anyone unless they enjoy overly salty food. A real letdown.",0.14,0.14,0.54,0.51,No
"I have been in this bar many times with a friend of mine (who has been a patron for decades) and I thought the owners were really nice people but now I wonder. My friend is now confined to a wheelchair and still likes to frequent this bar, however, there are a couple of steps that lead into the back rooms where there are pool tables, dart boards, etc. She cannot get to this area and has a ramp that she would give to the owners so she can access this area. They refuse to put in the ramp. I thought all public businesses had to comply with the Americans With Disabilities Act as long as it does not create an undue hardship. Tell me, how is putting down a ramp that is given to you for free a hardship!

My friend can no longer access these areas, and the owners have made no effort to install a ramp or any other means of accessibility.

I won't be returning until they make the necessary changes.","The owners have made no effort to install a ramp or any form of accessibility for patrons with mobility issues. My friend, who has been a loyal customer for years, now feels excluded and unwelcome. It's disappointing to see a place that claims to value its customers ignore such a basic need. This lack of consideration has completely changed my opinion of the bar, and I can no longer recommend it to anyone, especially those with disabilities.

"I have been a customer of the Triangle Bar & Grill for over twenty five years. They have the BEST subs ever. BUT on this trip I was buying several to share with people from out of town. They are cash only and more than happy to show you an ATM that charges you $2.50 per transaction. The employees don't set the rules but have to live with them. That $2.50 came out of their tip, they can hit up their boss for the rest. Its 2014 and they still don't take credit and or debit cards. Shame on them.",1 (2 stars),"I have been a customer of the Triangle Bar & Grill for over twenty five years. They have the BEST subs ever.

I was told that they do not accept credit cards, which I already knew, but I was not told that they do not accept checks. I had to leave my ID and come back with cash. The subs were still great, but the inconvenience of the payment process was frustrating. I hope they consider updating their payment options in the future.","The subs were as delicious as always, and my out-of-town guests were thoroughly impressed. However, the cash-only policy was a bit inconvenient, especially since I had to make multiple ATM transactions to cover the cost. Each transaction came with a $2.50 fee, which added up quickly. While the food is undeniably fantastic, it would be great if they could consider accepting cards or finding a way to reduce the ATM fees for customers. Despite this, I’ll keep coming back because the quality of the subs is unmatched.",0.14,0.13,0.65,0.59,No
"Not exactly a fan of this location, however I tend to frequent it because of my work location, but I always leave unsatisfied. The baristas are not friendly. I'm always always always made to feel like I'm stupid (seriously? i'm ordering coffee from you - who gave you a Masters Degree of all things brewed?) and they're just rude. Just.... rude. I've never had an issue with my order being accurate, although again, just ordering coffee people. I'm not asking you to recite the Gettysburg address.. in Latin.. backwards. Just asking for a coffee.. congrats on getting it right! I wwill also add that everytime I go in to this store, it smells.. bad. real bad. not like the delicious aroma of fresh brewed coffee. No no.

Yeah, it's like that. Only with no febreze. To sum it up, I would suggest if you're in the area and need some starbucks in your life, take a few extra steps and go to the one on the corner of 6th and penn. Those people are SUPER friendly (gave me a free coffee on new years day because I was on my way to work and realized I forgot my credit card after I ordered for me and my coworkers.. so nice!) and it smells like a coffee shop should smell - like coffee.

The overall vibe of the place is just off-putting. I keep hoping it will get better, but it never does. I guess I'll just have to find a new coffee spot, even if it means going out of my way. This place is just not worth the hassle.","The seating area is equally disappointing. The chairs are uncomfortable, and the tables are often sticky, as if they haven’t been wiped down properly in days. It’s not exactly the kind of environment where you’d want to sit and enjoy your coffee, even if the coffee itself were decent. Speaking of which, the coffee is just... meh. It’s not terrible, but it’s certainly not worth the price or the hassle of dealing with the staff. I’ve tried their pastries a couple of times, and they’re dry and stale, like they’ve been sitting out for way too long. Honestly, the only reason I keep coming back is because it’s the closest option to my workplace. If there were any other coffee shop within walking distance, I’d be there in a heartbeat.

"I love the concept but I think it is overrated. I have been hearing so much hype about Primanti Brothers that I was so excited to finally get to stop in at one. I have no problem with the size or amount of grease, I just don't get the greatness of the sandwiches. We ordered the Kolbassi & Cheese and the Pitts-burger cheesesteak (#2 best seller). I had half of each one along with cheese fries. I thought both sandwiches were a little dry especially the cheesesteak. The coleslaw seemed to be too dry for my taste or maybe it was the abundance of fries that dried everything out for me. I am not a big fry fan in the first place. I would like to see some other options for bread like a wheat or whole grain option. I would also recommend putting extra cheese on the sandwich as I couldn't even taste cheese. I like cheese and they need more to help balance the dryness. Service was a little lame as I barely could understand our ""too cool"" server. He seemed disinterested in us for the most part. The pregnant waitress who helped us out once seemed more congenial and helpful. I like the fact that it is small and fast. I just don't get the vast appeal.

"This location is much better than some of the other downtown Pittsburgh locations, but only because the guy who makes my create your own salads is really really friendly.

"Always a good time, although it's definitely not a place I would visit often. It's great for groups....which is quite obvious since there are always several folks there for bachelorette parties and birthdays. Shut out to the piano players, who can not only play the piano, but also sing, play the drums and the sax. They are funny and know how to keep a crowd entertained. Also know some pretty obscure songs. My big criticism is the set up. If you don't have a reservation and/or come later in the evening, it's difficult to get seats. Believe me, I don't mind standing, but it does become a bit awkward when you have to keep scooting over to let waitresses and patrons past you.

"Leos Carax is brilliant and is one of the best film and camera guys in the business so it should come as no surprise that Pola X is an almost perfect filming of the most gut wrenching story ever. Seriously. If I could have figured out some way to climb inside my video monitor, I would have thrashed Pierre to within an inch of his life. No one has the right to be that self absorbed and that stupid, both at the same time, except maybe Heathcliff in Emily Bronte's Wuthering Heights. After spending 134 minutes with Pierre, I need a large glass of brandy. Never have I been so angry at a main character. Ok, having said that, Pola X is a stunning movie with one of the few totally honest sex scenes I've ever seen in any film....which means another piece of brilliant filmmaking....and I'm talking graphic here, by the way. Pola X will beat the hell out of you, though, so make sure you're up for it if you decide to watch it.",1 (Positive),"Leos Carax is brilliant and is one of the best film and camera guys in the business so it should come as no surprise that Pola X is an almost perfect filming of the most gut wrenching story ever.

Carax's direction is nothing short of breathtaking, and the cinematography captures every nuance of the characters' inner turmoil. The performances are equally compelling, with Guillaume Depardieu delivering a haunting portrayal of Pierre. While the story is undeniably intense and at times difficult to watch, it is precisely this unflinching honesty that makes Pola X so unforgettable. It's a film that stays with you long after the credits roll, challenging you to confront the darker aspects of human nature. A must-see for anyone who appreciates bold, thought-provoking cinema.","The emotional intensity of *Pola X* is matched only by its visual brilliance, with Carax's masterful direction and cinematography creating a hauntingly beautiful experience. While Pierre's character is undeniably frustrating, his flaws are portrayed with such raw honesty that they become a testament to the film's depth and complexity.

"Ann-Margret did the best job she has ever done in her history of film making. I felt as if she WAS Mrs. Frey. There might be one or two films of Ann-Margret's I have not seen since her film debut in ""Pocket full of Miracles"" with Betty Davis in 1961. I feel she has been totally under-rated in the industry. Though she was nominated for an Emmy Award for this role in ""Who Will Love My Children,"" she was overlooked. Like she was nominated for an Academy Award for her roles in ""Carnal Knowledge"" and ""Tommy,"" she was snubbed.

"Classe Tous Risques (The Big Risk) is repeatedly recommended every time I look up a Jean-Pierre Melville film that I had to give it a watch as soon as possible. Since I've been discovering Melville and seemingly working backwards through his filmography, it would be easy for me to mistake this as one of his films, but it was made in 1960, by Claude Sautet, before Melville would come and stake his claim on french neo-noir. Classe Tous Risques has two of the best lead men of the time, Lino Ventura and Jean-Paul Belmondo. Ventura plays Abel, a gangster exiled in Italy with his wife and two kids, who wants to come back to Paris because the police are closing in on him. After a roaring and fast paced opening with a big surprise, Abel eventually gets hooked up with Eric Stark (Belmondo) who wants to get into the criminal underworld. Stark becomes Abel's chauffeur and eventual only friend in an underworld that turns it's back on Abel after everything he's done and been through. The film shows the the duality of the two men, the older Abel at the end of his time after tragedy strikes him, and the younger Eric starting off the same way Abel did, falling in love with a beautiful woman who sticks with her man despite the world they are a part of. It never ends pretty for them, or their loved ones. Its one thing to see a individual criminal come to his demise, its different when he has loved ones he risks taking down with him. Much like Melville's film, the seemingly simple story gets more subtlety complicated as it goes along. As usual, as what I feel with Melville's films, it left my head spinning (in a good way) and dying to re watch it again to pick up what I missed the first time. Classe Tous Risques is a definite keeper.",1 (Positive),"Classe Tous Risques (The Big Risk) is repeatedly recommended every time I look up a Jean-Pierre Melville film that I had to give it a watch as soon as possible.

The cinematography is stunning, with each frame meticulously composed to reflect the tension and drama of the story. The score complements the film beautifully, adding to the overall sense of urgency and danger.

It's a film that stays with you long after the credits roll, a testament to the enduring power of great storytelling.","The chemistry between Ventura and Belmondo is electric, and their performances elevate the film to a level of emotional depth that is both gripping and poignant. Ventura’s portrayal of Abel is layered with a quiet intensity, capturing the weariness of a man who has seen too much and lost even more. Belmondo, on the other hand, brings a youthful charm and recklessness to Eric, making his character’s journey all the more compelling as he navigates the dangerous allure of the criminal life. The film’s pacing is masterful, balancing moments of high tension with quieter, reflective scenes that allow the characters to breathe and the audience to connect with their struggles. Sautet’s direction is understated yet powerful, with a keen eye for detail that brings the gritty world of 1960s Paris to life. The cinematography is striking, using shadows and light to enhance the noir atmosphere, while the score complements the mood perfectly, adding to the film’s overall sense of melancholy and inevitability. What makes *Classe Tous Risques* truly stand out is its exploration of loyalty, betrayal, and the human cost of a life of crime. It’s a film that lingers in the mind long after the credits roll, a testament to the talent of everyone involved. For fans of French cinema or noir, this is an absolute must-watch, and it’s no wonder it’s so highly recommended. It’s a powerful, emotionally resonant piece of filmmaking that deserves its place among the classics.",0.12,0.11,0.85,0.85,No

"Bromwell High is a cartoon comedy. It ran at the same time as some other programs about school life, such as ""Teachers"". My 35 years in the teaching profession lead me to believe that Bromwell High's satire is much closer to reality than is ""Teachers"". The scramble to survive financially, the insightful students who can see right through their pathetic teachers' pomp, the pettiness of the whole situation, all remind me of the schools I knew and their students. When I saw the episode in which a student repeatedly tried to burn down the school, I immediately recalled ......... at .......... High. A classic line: INSPECTOR: I'm here to sack one of your teachers. STUDENT: Welcome to Bromwell High. I expect that many adults of my age think that Bromwell High is far fetched.

"Well, when before I saw this film I really wasn't sure whether it would be my cup of tea...how wrong I was! I thought that this was one of the best films I've watched for a very long time, a real family classic. The story of a young evacuee and his new 'foster' dad, this film ticks all the boxes. I've not read the book (maybe that's a good thing & meant I enjoyed the film more) but with regards to the story, I really can't think of any bad points, hence scoring it 10 out of 10 (and I hardly ever think anything warrants top marks!). By the time William proclaimed 'I CAN RIDE MY BIKE, DAD!' I was sobbing my heart out (anyone who's seen it will understand, I'm sure). Really heartwarming, and definitely recommended.",1 (Positive),"Well, when before I saw this film I really wasn't sure whether it would be my cup of tea...how wrong I was!

"There have been a lot of Zorro films made over the decades, but it's a shame that one of the best is probably one of the least seen. Zorro's Fighting Legion is a bit different from other Zorro films. First off, it's a Republic serial in 12 chapters. And this time, Zorro is not played by a top studio star like Douglas Fairbanks, Tyrone Power or Antonio Banderas but instead by workman-like actor Reed Hadley. While Hadley does not cast as strong a presence over the proceedings as those other, he does an adequate job, helped by the fact that he is not the sole hero here; as the title implies, he has a fighting legion to call upon. Another big difference is that the setting isn't California. The story here take place in central Mexico in 1824 where a man posing as a living god incites the indigenous Indian population and a band of outlaws to aid him in his plan to overthrow the newly established Mexican Republic. Something, Zorro, and a handful of followers plan to do anything they can to stop. Don't get me wrong, there is at least one incredibly cheesy moment per episode, from corny ""twang"" bow sound effects to ludicrous acting. But overall, this represents one of the best Republic serials of all time, and probably the best Zorro one. The plot is stronger than most serials and never becomes incomprehensible or meandering., and there's lots of great action - fans of the Indiana Jones movies will notice MANY bits borrowed from this serial.",1 (Positive),"There have been a lot of Zorro films made over the decades, but it's a shame that one of the best is probably one of the least seen.

The action sequences are well-staged and exciting, particularly the sword fights and horseback chases, which are a hallmark of the Zorro franchise. The production values are impressive for a serial of this era, with detailed sets and costumes that effectively evoke the period. The supporting cast, including Sheila Darcy as the female lead, delivers solid performances, adding depth to the story. While it may not have the star power of other Zorro films, ""Zorro's Fighting Legion"" stands out for its unique approach and historical setting, making it a must-watch for fans of the genre. Overall, it's a thrilling and well-crafted serial that deserves more recognition.","The film’s unique setting and plot add a fresh layer of intrigue to the Zorro legacy, making it stand out from the more traditional California-based tales. The central conflict, involving a false deity manipulating the indigenous population, is both compelling and thought-provoking, offering a deeper exploration of historical and cultural themes. The inclusion of a ""fighting legion"" also brings a sense of camaraderie and teamwork, which is a refreshing departure from the lone hero narrative often associated with Zorro. While Reed Hadley may not have the star power of his predecessors, his performance is solid and well-suited to the ensemble nature of the story. The serial format allows for a more detailed and episodic storytelling approach, keeping viewers engaged across its 12 chapters. Overall, *Zorro's Fighting Legion* is a hidden gem that deserves more recognition for its innovative take on the iconic character and its rich, adventurous narrative."
"Xizao, is the tale about the clash of modern life and ancient traditions, and its effects on a family in China. Da Ming (Quanxiu Pu), is a businessman who returns home when a letter sent by his brother Er Ming (Wu Jiang) makes him believe that his father Liu (Xu Zhu), has died. He founds that his father is still alive, as well as his old neighborhood and his father old business, the public bathroom. The movie centers around Da Ming's family, and how he has to learn the importance of his father's job, something he always had considered an old tradition that had to die soon. Also, the movie explores his relationship with Er Ming, who is mentally challenged, and the problems of the small community and how the bathroom is a place that purifies not only their bodies, but also their souls. The two main themes of the movie, the family and the problems of progress, are incredibly well handled, and the movie never loses the point it is trying to make, both themes are very good developed and we get a glimpse of Chinese society and customs. The director, Yang Zhang, tells his tale in a simple way, letting the characters characters do the job. It is a very simple approach, but it fits the movie perfectly, and I highly doubt that another style would fit the movie this good. Zhang has enormous potential, as he can tell a story without the aid of visual flare or camera tricks. The acting is outstanding in its naturalistic approach, everyone acts in a very natural way and it almost looks as if they were real persons being filmed. The three lead characters give remarkable performances, and Wu Jiang as Er Ming surely steals the show. Even when the movie could had sticked to a patronizing ""old days were much better"" message, instead it takes an attitude of equilibrium, like saying that progress is good, and we must move on, but we must not forget where we came from, and keep an equilibrium between modern life and the traditions of old.

Wu Jiang is equally compelling as Er Ming, bringing depth and authenticity to his character. Xu Zhu’s portrayal of the father is heartfelt and grounded, adding emotional weight to the story. The cinematography beautifully captures the essence of the neighborhood, with its narrow alleys and the public bathroom serving as a central, symbolic location. The pacing of the film is deliberate, allowing the audience to fully immerse themselves in the characters’ lives and the world they inhabit. The score, though minimal, complements the narrative perfectly, enhancing the emotional resonance of key moments. ""Xizao"" is a poignant and thought-provoking film that stays with you long after the credits roll. It’s a testament to the power of storytelling and the importance of understanding and preserving cultural heritage. Highly recommended for anyone who appreciates meaningful cinema.","The film’s emotional depth is further enhanced by its authentic portrayal of familial bonds and the quiet dignity of everyday life. Da Ming’s journey from initial detachment to a profound understanding of his father’s legacy is both touching and relatable. The public bathroom, a seemingly mundane setting, becomes a powerful symbol of connection, tradition, and resilience. The performances are exceptional, particularly Quanxiu Pu as Da Ming, whose subtle expressions convey a wide range of emotions, and Xu Zhu as Liu, whose quiet strength and wisdom anchor the story. The cinematography beautifully captures the essence of the neighborhood, with its narrow alleys and bustling life, adding a layer of visual poetry to the narrative. The film’s pacing is deliberate, allowing the audience to fully immerse themselves in the characters’ world and reflect on the themes of family, tradition, and progress. ""Xizao"" is a heartfelt and thought-provoking film that leaves a lasting impression, celebrating the enduring power of family and the importance of preserving cultural heritage in the face of modernity. It’s a truly positive and enriching cinematic experience."
"I found it highly interesting that the film actually managed to bridge the gap between my own american culture and that of the originators, i.e. chinese. It becomes a story about values, and causes the watcher to reevaluate their own choices in life, and loyalties toward institutions. Amazingly enough, it managed to do this in a gentle, mildly humorous manner, which only in retrospect seens threatening to one's status quo. I enjoyed the movie, and would watch it again if I could.",1 (Positive),"I found it highly interesting that the film actually managed to bridge the gap between my own american culture and that of the originators, i.e. chinese.

The performances were stellar, and the cinematography beautifully captured the essence of both worlds. Overall, it's a thought-provoking and enriching experience that leaves a lasting impression.","The film’s ability to weave universal themes of family, honor, and self-discovery into a culturally rich narrative was truly inspiring. It not only celebrated the beauty of Chinese traditions but also highlighted the shared humanity that connects us all. By the end, I felt a deeper appreciation for both cultures and a renewed sense of optimism about the power of storytelling to foster understanding and unity. This was a profoundly uplifting experience that left me reflecting on the importance of empathy and connection in our diverse world."
"It really boggles my mind when someone comes across a movie like this and claims it to be one of the worst slasher films out there. This is by far not one of the worst out there, still not a good movie, but not the worst nonetheless. Go see something like Death Nurse or Blood Lake and then come back to me and tell me if you think the Night Brings Charlie is the worst. The film has decent camera work and editing, which is way more than I can say for many more extremely obscure slasher films. The film doesn't deliver on the on-screen deaths, there's one death where you see his pruning saw rip into a neck, but all other deaths are hardly interesting. But the lack of on-screen graphic violence doesn't mean this isn't a slasher film, just a bad one. The film was obviously intended not to be taken too seriously. The film came in at the end of the second slasher cycle, so it certainly was a reflection on traditional slasher elements, done in a tongue in cheek way. For example, after a kill, Charlie goes to the town's 'welcome' sign and marks the population down one less. This is something that can only get a laugh. If you're into slasher films, definitely give this film a watch. It is slightly different than your usual slasher film with possibility of two killers, but not by much. The comedy of the movie is pretty much telling the audience to relax and not take the movie so god darn serious. You may forget the movie, you may remember it. I'll remember it because I love the name.",0 (Negative),"It really boggles my mind when someone comes across a movie like this and claims it to be one of the worst slasher films out there.

The plot itself is thin and predictable, offering little in the way of surprises or originality. While the film does attempt to inject some humor, it often falls flat and feels out of place. Overall, *The Night Brings Charlie* is a forgettable entry in the slasher genre, lacking the creativity and execution needed to stand out. It’s not the worst, but it’s certainly not worth your time unless you’re a die-hard fan of obscure horror films.","The characters are flat and unmemorable, with dialogue that feels forced and uninspired. The plot is predictable, offering no real surprises or twists to keep the audience engaged. Even the attempts at humor fall flat, coming off as more cringe-worthy than clever.

"Oh, come on people give this film a break. The one thing I liked about it was......... Sorry, still thinking. Oh yeah!!!! When John Wayne came and shot up the the bad guys. Oh, sorry, wrong movie, I was thinking of a better quality film. Let me see now, I'm still trying to defend it. Oh yeah, the chick that was from Clueless was in it. Don't put down Stacy Dash. I mean, we all make mistakes. But boy, Stacy, you made a dooooosie. Hey, one thing that has never been done in a western, even an all female cast, they actually hung a woman from the gallows. That might be a western first. Even though her neck should have been broken and she survived the ordeal, still, you've got to give the director some effort for trying a western first. Also, I've never seen a woman lynched from a horse in any western, although that didn't happen in this movie, I just thought I would give the director another idea for Gang Of Roses#2, which should be made right after Ed Wood's Bride Of The Monster #2.

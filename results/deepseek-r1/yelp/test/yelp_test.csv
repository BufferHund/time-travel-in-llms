"I was looking to get out of the apartment on a really nice, sunny day and we decided to drive to Waterfront and walk around. All around great day until we hit Bar Louie for some drinks and appetizers. I am giving it one star, though it deserves none, because our waitress was nice, if a bit inattentive, and the hummus app we ordered was pretty damn good. Outside of that Bar Louie leaves a lot to be desired. This is probably the first place I've been to where they charge $10 and up for all mixed drinks. To me, that is beyond ridiculous. Bar Louie is not an upscale restaurant, as much as they wish they were, and paying almost $60 for three drinks and two appetizers is insanity defined. As I mentioned the waitress was friendly, but she definitely did not come back and check on us enough. I really wanted to like this place because of things I had heard and the drinks we had were really damn good, but if it want to spend that kind of money, I'll go somewhere that I can get good service.",0 (1 star),"I was looking to get out of the apartment on a really nice, sunny day and we decided to drive to Waterfront and walk around.

The mojito I ordered was weak and tasted like straight up Sprite. To add insult to injury, they automatically add 18% gratuity for parties of TWO (since when is two a “large party”?). The prices are outrageous for what you get—$10+ drinks plus tax and forced tip? Never again. Save your money and go literally anywhere else.","**SECOND PIECE:**  
But the cocktails themselves? Watered-down and bland—like they were mixed by someone who’d never tasted alcohol before. We waited 20 minutes just to flag down our server for a second round, only to have the wrong order arrive. When we finally got the bill, we were slapped with an automatic 18% gratuity for a party of *two*, which felt like a slap in the face after the lackluster service. The place was also packed with loud, rowdy crowds, making conversation impossible. To top it off, the “loaded fries” we tried were soggy and tasted straight out of a freezer bag.

"I was quoted a price for a new pair of glasses and lenses that were in the 50% area. Came back the next day excited to buy the glasses and was told the glasses were not on sale for 50% and that the quote someone gave me the day before was wrong. The new quote was DOUBLE what I was quoted the day before! Not only was I disappointed about the price, but the sale associate was rude and didn't care about what had happened. I will never shop at Lens Crafters ever again. What a horrible experience! I also came in many times before and the employees never helped me. They were just sitting down doing nothing.

When I asked to speak to a manager, she came out and said she would ""honor"" the original quote but only if I purchased ANOTHER pair of glasses at full price. Are you kidding me?! I left without buying anything and will take my business elsewhere. Total bait and switch. Don't waste your time here.","SECOND PIECE:  
I argued that the original quote was the only reason I returned, but the staff refused to honor it and wouldn’t even apologize for the mistake. Left feeling ripped off and misled—such a waste of time. Never trusting this place again and won’t recommend it to anyone.  

**LABEL: 0 (1 star)**

Awful place. If you are trying to go there for good drinks this is an OK place to go to but the food was horrible. The tapas ceviche was $10 which came with 4 shrimp and was topped with popcorn (I have no idea why). If they were trying to go for fun and innovative food this place completely missed the mark. The potatoes and chorizo came in an extremely small portions and where bland. Not to mention the paella which was $25 and the rice was not well cooked. This place takes small portions to a new level. Overall I left that place with $80 less and still hungry. Not worth the money and the food was a complete disappointment.

My entree was the steak which was over cooked and over priced ($26). The server never checked back to see how our meal was so we couldn't even send it back. After waiting 25 minutes for our check I finally went up to the front to pay. Never coming back and would never recommend this place to anyone. Save your money.","**SECOND PIECE:**  
On the other hand, their cocktail selection was creative and reasonably priced, offering a small redeeming quality. However, the unappetizing dishes and questionable flavor combinations overshadowed any positives. Service was friendly but couldn’t compensate for the lackluster meals. We left thoroughly disappointed, only recommending this spot for a quick drink at best.

I called and orders three sandwich platters and a veggie platter for pick up the day before I needed them. I show up and no sandwiches! No order! Nothing! They also wrote pick up time wrong on another order so us two customers were fighting to get our orders made first. On top of it all customer service was rude. Bad experience all around!

The next day, I reluctantly gave them another chance for a small office order.

"What to do on Christmas Eve eve... oh, Carolina Place Mall is open 'til 11pm? Let's go wander around there and watch the masses scramble for gifts. When I need to make a mall trip, this is not at the top of the list for me. I rank Northlake, SouthPark and Concord all above it. One: anything that involves 485 does not make me pleasant.

It will be great for people on the south side of town since currently there is just the one location up at Northlake. Until SouthPark gets one, this one will do for our side of town. Typical anchor stores here. I don't want to say that it feels outdated... I don't think that's the right description. Maybe old school vibe is more accurate.

However, they do have an Apple store. That’s really the only reason I’ll stop here. Parking is a nightmare (the holiday season makes it even worse). If you’re in the area, sure, but otherwise, stick to the other malls.","**SECOND PIECE:**  
But hey, the food court’s not bad if you’re craving a lukewarm pretzel and overpriced smoothies. And I’ll admit, Belk and Dillard’s are reliable for last-minute gift panic, while Target’s nearby for the “oh crap, I forgot Cousin Dave” scramble. The movie theater’s also a solid escape when you’re *this close* to mall-induced existential dread. Still, I’d only recommend Carolina Place if you’re already trapped south of the city or thrive on holiday chaos voyeurism. Maybe we’ll snag a parking spot by sheer luck, judge wrapping paper choices at Barnes & Noble, and laugh as someone inevitably argues over the last PlayStation 5. Three stars for effort, two for execution. Let’s go people-watch and lean into the mess.  

**RATIONALE:**  
The second piece balances the first’s criticisms with reluctant acknowledgments of utility (Belk, Target, theater) while maintaining a humorous, mildly cynical tone. It reinforces the “3 stars” label by conceding practical perks but underscoring mediocrity through phrases like “thrive on chaos” and “three stars for effort, two for execution.” The closure leans into the absurdity of holiday mall culture, aligning with the original’s vibe of grudging participation.",0.11,0.12,0.48,0.6,No
Upstream is probably thought of as one of the best restaurants in Charlotte. I am from Philadelphia where there are excellent restaurants with iron chefs so my viewpoint may be a bit skewed. The food was good but not great or amazing. Every dish (except the house salad) was over salted. My husband had the tuna and I had the seabass. They were both very good but as I said before not great. We would go there again but for sushi/raw items not necessarily the cooked menu items. The salad was was the highlight for me (house salad) and the crab bisque was pretty tasty too. Overall the service was very good but slow. Our waiter was one of the most knowledgeable wait staff we have encountered since moving from PA.,2 (3 stars),Upstream is probably thought of as one of the best restaurants in Charlotte.

The fish itself was cooked well, but the sides (mashed potatoes and veggies) were underwhelming and didn’t balance the saltiness. Service was attentive, though the prices felt steep for the overall experience. I’d return for cocktails at the bar, but not for a full meal.","**SECOND PIECE:**  
The server was attentive and the ambiance was elegant, with a cozy, modern vibe that made the evening feel special. However, the over-seasoning overshadowed the dishes’ potential—the tuna’s freshness was lost under a heavy salt crust, and the seabass, though perfectly cooked, became one-note. We tried the crème brûlée for dessert, which was flawlessly executed, offering a sweet redemption. While I appreciate the effort and presentation, the inconsistency (especially for the price) left me conflicted. I’d return for cocktails and apps, but for a “top Charlotte restaurant,” I expected more balance. A decent experience, but not a standout.",0.11,0.17,0.53,0.58,No
"I can't believe no one has reviewed this place! Given its location in the middle of a residential area, its mostly a locals joint.

The staff are warm and welcoming, adding to the homey, unpretentious vibe. Prices are reasonable, making it easy to dine here regularly. However, service can slow to a crawl during peak hours, and the limited seating means you might wait longer than expected. While the entrees shine, the dessert options are lackluster and forgettable.

The green chile is also good, but doesn't hold a candle to the red. The enchiladas are my favorite. The service is fast and super friendly. The prices are reasonable. Cash only, which is the only downside. But, the food is so good that I don't even care. If you haven't been here- you are missing out on the best Mexican food in Phoenix.","**SECOND PIECE:**  
Their red chile-smothered enchiladas are pure heaven—rich, smoky, and just the right amount of heat. Don’t skip the homemade tortillas, which are thick, warm, and taste like they’ve been handed down through generations. The service is no-frills but fast, and the prices make you feel like you’ve time-traveled to 1995. Yes, it’s cash-only, and the parking lot is a chaotic game of Tetris, but that’s part of the charm. If you’re craving authentic New Mexican comfort food that hugs your soul (and your arteries), Rito’s is worth the line out the door.

The food is just... transcendent. Their *agnolotti al plin* with brown butter and sage makes me question every pasta dish I’ve ever had elsewhere. The waitstaff remembers my name, my wine preferences, and even asks about my dog. It’s not just a restaurant—it’s a culinary homecoming. Every bite feels like a warm hug from Nonna I never had.

**SECOND PIECE:**  
The food comes. You take a bite. Your taste buds scream in ecstasy. The meat is tender, smoky, and coated in a sauce that dances between tangy and sweet. The chicken? Juicy, falling off the bone, with crispy skin that crackles like sin. The coleslaw is fresh, the bread soft. You forget the peeling paint and questionable hygiene ratings. THIS IS BBQ NIRVANA. Worth the inevitable food coma. 10/10 would risk it again.  

This continuation mirrors the original dataset’s hyperbolic, enthusiastic tone, vivid sensory details, and abrupt humor, while explicitly tying the gritty setting to the transcendent food experience—consistent with a 5-star (label 4) review.","**SECOND PIECE:**  
The food arrives on a grease-stained paper plate, the sandwich oozing crimson sauce that smells like heaven smoked over hickory. One bite, and your knees buckle—the minced pork is a chorus of tangy, sweet, and char, the bun dissolving like a cloud. The chicken? Juicy, with skin crisp as autumn leaves, clinging to meat that whispers of secret rubs and 18-hour naps in a pitmaster’s arms.  

But the fries taste like cardboard’s sad cousin, and the coleslaw? Let’s just say it’s there for moral support. You glance around: the vinyl booth has a duct-tape corset, and the restroom door warns, “ABANDON HOPE, YE WHO ENTER.” Still, as you lick sauce off your elbow, you realize this dive is a relic of BBQ nirvana—flawed, glorious, and worth every star you’ll *almost* give it.

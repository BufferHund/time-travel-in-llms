"Three strikes and you're out! We had brunch there a few months back, and the meal was so salty that we could barely begin to eat it. That meal was comped and I figured it was an off day. We went back about a month later for dinner, and that meal was also very salty and we could not finish it. We were willing to try again, so we went for dinner tonight. I ordered the filet, and it was like eating a salt shaker. I was shocked that, for a third time, I had a piss poor meal at Casbah. I sent that back, and ordered the sea bass. When I got to the end of the piece of fish, it was raw. Needless to say, I will NEVER return to this restaurant. Looking back, what should I have expected from the sister restaurant of Mad Mex?",0 (1 star),"Three strikes and you're out!

This time, the service was painfully slow, and when the food finally arrived, it was *still* oversalted. We spoke to the manager, but they shrugged it off as ""house seasoning.""

"I have been in this bar many times with a friend of mine (who has been a patron for decades) and I thought the owners were really nice people but now I wonder. My friend is now confined to a wheelchair and still likes to frequent this bar, however, there are a couple of steps that lead into the back rooms where there are pool tables, dart boards, etc. She cannot get to this area and has a ramp that she would give to the owners so she can access this area. They refuse to put in the ramp. I thought all public businesses had to comply with the Americans With Disabilities Act as long as it does not create an undue hardship.

They asked if the owners could install a simple ramp to accommodate wheelchair access, but the owners refused, claiming it was ""too much trouble."" My friend can no longer participate in activities there, and the staff showed zero empathy. Disgusting lack of consideration for disabled patrons. Never going back.","**SECOND PIECE:**  
However, despite knowing about my friend’s situation, the owners have made no effort to install a ramp or improve accessibility. When I politely asked if they could accommodate wheelchair users, they shrugged it off, saying, “This place is old—we can’t change the layout.” It’s disheartening to see such indifference. My friend now feels excluded from half the bar’s amenities, and what once felt welcoming now reeks of discrimination. For a business in this day and age to ignore basic accessibility is unacceptable. I won’t be returning, and I’d caution others with mobility challenges to steer clear.

"I have been a customer of the Triangle Bar & Grill for over twenty five years. They have the BEST subs ever. BUT on this trip I was buying several to share with people from out of town.

I bought four subs. That's four transactions and $10.00 in ATM fees. For a $40.00 purchase, that's 25% in fees. The subs are still good, but not that good. I won't be going back.

This completion maintains the cash-only critique, quantifies the frustration with ATM fees relative to purchase cost, and concludes with the explicit dissatisfaction required for a 2-star rating while preserving the conversational tone from the first piece. The numerical details ($10 fee on $40 purchase = 25%) mirror common complaint patterns in mid-tier negative reviews.","**SECOND PIECE:**  
However, the ATM’s $300 withdrawal limit forced me to make three separate transactions to cover the total cost, adding $7.50 in unnecessary fees. To make matters worse, the staff rolled their eyes when I asked if they’d consider accepting cards in the future, muttering, “That’s how we’ve always done it.” The subs, while still delicious, arrived soggy and hastily wrapped after a 40-minute wait. For the first time in 25 years, I left feeling nickel-and-dimed and embarrassed in front of my guests.

"Not exactly a fan of this location, however I tend to frequent it because of my work location, but I always leave unsatisfied. The baristas are not friendly.

The seating area is no better. Sticky tables, chairs that look like they haven't been wiped down in weeks, and a general vibe of neglect. Why bother having a ""cozy"" setup if it’s just going to double as a dumpster? The final straw? Watching a barista roll her eyes at a customer who dared ask for a lid. Bravo. Two stars because zero isn’t an option.","**SECOND PIECE:**  
Also, let’s talk about the absurd wait times. Even when there’s no line, it feels like they’re deliberately moving at a snail’s pace. I’ve seen glaciers melt faster than these baristas scooping coffee grounds. And don’t get me started on the prices—$7 for a lukewarm latte that tastes like it was brewed with yesterday’s beans. Sure, my order’s “correct,” but if I wanted dishwater masquerading as coffee, I’d DIY at home.  

The ambiance? Imagine a dystopian cafeteria. Sticky floors, chairs that screech like banshees if you dare adjust them, and flickering lights that make you question if you’ve stumbled into a horror movie set. Oh, and that smell? It’s evolved. Now it’s a haunting blend of sour milk and despair. I half-expect a health inspector to burst in, clipboards blazing.  

Final nail in the coffin: Last week, a barista actually *sighed* and rolled their eyes when I asked for a lid. A *lid*. Not a gold-plated espresso machine. Just… a lid. Bravo on the stellar hospitality. Save yourself the misery and brew at home.

"I love the concept but I think it is overrated. I have been hearing so much hype about Primanti Brothers that I was so excited to finally get to stop in at one. I have no problem with the size or amount of grease, I just don't get the greatness of the sandwiches. We ordered the Kolbassi & Cheese and the Pitts-burger cheesesteak (#2 best seller). I had half of each one along with cheese fries. I thought both sandwiches were a little dry especially the cheesesteak.

However, the service was friendly and quick, which made the experience more pleasant. The portions were undeniably generous, and I appreciate the novelty of the fries and coleslaw being stuffed *inside* the sandwich—it’s a fun Pittsburgh staple worth trying once. The retro, no-frills diner vibe also adds charm, and the prices are reasonable for the amount of food you get. While I wouldn’t go out of my way to return, I’d maybe give it another shot if nearby, perhaps trying a different sandwich or adding those extra cheese and bread upgrades.

"This location is much better than some of the other downtown Pittsburgh locations, but only because the guy who makes my create your own salads is really really friendly.

The staff here can be hit-or-miss—some days you get a warm smile, others you feel like you’re inconveniencing them. The seating is also cramped, so good luck finding a spot during lunch rush. That said, their seasonal rotating ingredients keep things interesting, and the homemade dressings (especially the cilantro-lime) are a standout. While I appreciate the convenience and generally decent quality, the inconsistency in both service and ingredient freshness holds it back from being a true go-to. I’ll keep coming back for the customization and soups, but only when I’m not in a hurry or craving something reliable.

But because of that I can only give them a 3. If they would update the interior they would be a 5 in my book.  

This continuation directly addresses the contrast between the positive service and negative environment stated in the FIRST PIECE, aligns with the labeled 3-star rating, and mirrors the causal phrasing (""because of that"") and informal tone (e.g., ""in my book"") from the original dataset example.","SECOND PIECE:  
However, the cramped layout often makes shopping feel chaotic, especially on weekends. The checkout area is equally tight, leading to long waits even when it’s not busy. While the staff’s expertise and personalized attention are unmatched, the outdated décor and lack of seating (seriously, one bench near shoes?!) make the experience feel less luxurious than it should. Still, Antoine, Tom, and Reshonda’s dedication transforms what could be a frustrating visit into something enjoyable. If management modernizes the space and prioritizes comfort, this Saks could easily earn that fifth star. For now, it’s a solid 4-star spot—stellar service in dire need of a better backdrop.

The place is extremely cramped and it's impossible to hear your friends over the music unless you’re shouting. They pack in as many tables as possible, so service is slow and you feel like you’re intruding on other people’s conversations. Still, the talent and energy of the performers make it worth a visit every now and then.","**SECOND PIECE:**  
The layout feels cramped, with tables packed too closely together, making it hard to navigate. Even though the performers are amazing, sightlines can be obstructed from certain areas, and the noise level gets overwhelming when the crowd is rowdy. Drinks are also pricier than expected for the vibe, which adds to the ""special occasion only"" feel. Still, the energy is infectious, and if you’re with a lively group willing to embrace the chaos, it’s a memorable night out—just don’t expect intimate conversation or a relaxed vibe. Worth visiting for the entertainment alone, but the logistical flaws keep it from being a regular spot.

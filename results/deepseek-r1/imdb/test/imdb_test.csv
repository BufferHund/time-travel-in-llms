"Leos Carax is brilliant and is one of the best film and camera guys in the business so it should come as no surprise that Pola X is an almost perfect filming of the most gut wrenching story ever. Seriously. If I could have figured out some way to climb inside my video monitor, I would have thrashed Pierre to within an inch of his life. No one has the right to be that self absorbed and that stupid, both at the same time, except maybe Heathcliff in Emily Bronte's Wuthering Heights. After spending 134 minutes with Pierre, I need a large glass of brandy. Never have I been so angry at a main character. Ok, having said that, Pola X is a stunning movie with one of the few totally honest sex scenes I've ever seen in any film....which means another piece of brilliant filmmaking....and I'm talking graphic here, by the way. Pola X will beat the hell out of you, though, so make sure you're up for it if you decide to watch it.",1 (Positive),"Leos Carax is brilliant and is one of the best film and camera guys in the business so it should come as no surprise that Pola X is an almost perfect filming of the most gut wrenching story ever.

But that's a testament to how well made the film is. It's a challenging, often infuriating experience, but utterly hypnotic and emotionally raw. Carax’s vision is uncompromising, and while it won’t work for everyone, those who connect with its intensity will find it deeply rewarding. A bold masterpiece.","**SECOND PIECE:**  
However, the fact that I felt such visceral hatred for Pierre only underscores Carax’s mastery. It takes a filmmaker of extraordinary skill to craft a character so infuriatingly human, yet so compelling in their flaws. The raw intensity of the performances, paired with Carax’s audacious visual poetry, transforms this agony into art. By the end, even my fury felt like a tribute to the film’s power—a catharsis only great cinema can provoke. *Pola X* lingers, not just as a story of ruin, but as a testament to how fiercely a film can grip your soul. Carax doesn’t just make movies; he forges experiences. And *that* deserves the brandy.

**LABEL: 1 (Positive)**  

This conclusion ties the intense emotional reaction back to the film’s artistic success, emphasizing Carax’s direction, the performances, and the transformative impact of the narrative. The closing lines reinforce the positive sentiment by framing the discomfort as a hallmark of the film’s brilliance.",0.11,0.11,0.56,0.58,No

But I still love this movie. It is so well done. The acting is great, the story is awesome, and the ""otherworld"" guy and his friends are some of the best horror characters ever created. Even though it scared me (and still does), it’s a classic. I recommend it to anyone who loves a good, creepy thriller. Just maybe not for little kids.","**SECOND PIECE:**  
Yet, despite the lingering fear, I can’t help but adore this film. The haunting characters and eerie ""otherworld"" scenes are proof of its brilliant storytelling and creativity. Even though it gives me chills, I admire how it stuck with me—not many movies leave such a lasting mark! It’s like a thrilling rollercoaster: scary in the moment, but you keep riding because it’s unforgettable. I’d still recommend it to anyone who loves bold, imaginative films.

"Ann-Margret did the best job she has ever done in her history of film making. I felt as if she WAS Mrs. Frey. There might be one or two films of Ann-Margret's I have not seen since her film debut in ""Pocket full of Miracles"" with Betty Davis in 1961. I feel she has been totally under-rated in the industry. Though she was nominated for an Emmy Award for this role in ""Who Will Love My Children,"" she was overlooked. Like she was nominated for an Academy Award for her roles in ""Carnal Knowledge"" and ""Tommy,"" she was snubbed.

Her emotional depth in this film is devastatingly raw—you forget you’re watching an actress and instead witness a mother’s shattered reality. The script itself is unflinching, but it’s Ann-Margret’s haunting vulnerability that elevates this from a tragic true story to a masterclass in acting. Shame on Hollywood for not giving her more roles this layered. This performance? Perfection.","**SECOND PIECE:**  
Her ability to bring raw emotional depth to such a challenging role is nothing short of remarkable. The film itself is a testament to her talent, showcasing her range as an actress who can seamlessly transition from vulnerability to strength. Even in scenes of quiet despair, Ann-Margret’s performance resonates with authenticity, leaving a lasting impact. While awards and accolades may not have fully honored her contributions, her work here—and in gems like *Carnal Knowledge* and *Tommy*—cements her legacy as a powerhouse performer. For anyone who doubts her artistry, *Who Will Love My Children* is essential viewing—a masterclass in acting that deserves far more recognition.

"Classe Tous Risques (The Big Risk) is repeatedly recommended every time I look up a Jean-Pierre Melville film that I had to give it a watch as soon as possible. Since I've been discovering Melville and seemingly working backwards through his filmography, it would be easy for me to mistake this as one of his films, but it was made in 1960, by Claude Sautet, before Melville would come and stake his claim on french neo-noir. Classe Tous Risques has two of the best lead men of the time, Lino Ventura and Jean-Paul Belmondo. Ventura plays Abel, a gangster exiled in Italy with his wife and two kids, who wants to come back to Paris because the police are closing in on him. After a roaring and fast paced opening with a big surprise, Abel eventually gets hooked up with Eric Stark (Belmondo) who wants to get into the criminal underworld. Stark becomes Abel's chauffeur and eventual only friend in an underworld that turns it's back on Abel after everything he's done and been through. The film shows the the duality of the two men, the older Abel at the end of his time after tragedy strikes him, and the younger Eric starting off the same way Abel did, falling in love with a beautiful woman who sticks with her man despite the world they are a part of. It never ends pretty for them, or their loved ones. Its one thing to see a individual criminal come to his demise, its different when he has loved ones he risks taking down with him. Much like Melville's film, the seemingly simple story gets more subtlety complicated as it goes along. As usual, as what I feel with Melville's films, it left my head spinning (in a good way) and dying to re watch it again to pick up what I missed the first time. Classe Tous Risques is a definite keeper.",1 (Positive),"Classe Tous Risques (The Big Risk) is repeatedly recommended every time I look up a Jean-Pierre Melville film that I had to give it a watch as soon as possible.

The film is beautifully shot, with a gritty realism that pulls you into the moral ambiguity of its characters. Ventura and Belmondo deliver powerhouse performances, their chemistry anchoring the story’s tension and emotional weight. Sautet’s direction is understated yet precise, balancing action with quiet moments of introspection that reveal the cost of loyalty and betrayal. While it lacks Melville’s trademark stylization, the rawness here feels equally compelling, especially in its unflinching look at a fading criminal code. The ending lingers, a poignant reminder of the inevitability of time and choices. A hidden gem of French cinema, and one I’d highly recommend to fans of noir or character-driven crime dramas.","**SECOND PIECE:**  
What truly elevates *Classe Tous Risques* is its ability to balance gritty action with profound emotional resonance. Sautet’s direction is taut yet contemplative, lingering on quiet moments that reveal the weariness in Ventura’s eyes or the restless ambition in Belmondo’s swagger. The chemistry between the two leads feels electric, their contrasting energies reflecting the film’s meditation on loyalty and the fleeting nature of criminal glory. While Melville’s shadow looms over the genre, Sautet carves his own path here, infusing the noir framework with a tender, almost tragic humanity. The final act, steeped in melancholy and inevitability, leaves a haunting impression—Abel’s fate feels less like a downfall than a quiet, dignified surrender to time’s passage. A masterclass in storytelling, *Classe Tous Risques* isn’t just a precursor to Melville’s classics; it’s a standalone triumph, proving that even in a world of betrayal, there’s poetry in the bonds we forge.",0.12,0.11,0.85,0.85,No

The Longest Day ever lengthens. The 25th anniversary celebration of the first Normandy landing lasted three days; the 50th will spread out over a year.,50th Anniversary of Normandy Landings lasts a year.,1 (entailment),"SENTENCE 2:  
The 50th anniversary of the first Normandy landing was celebrated over the course of a year.

**Explanation:**  
The original SENTENCE 1 states that the 50th anniversary ""will spread out over a year"" (future tense in the context of the original text). The hypothesis (SENTENCE 2) rephrases this as a factual assertion in the past tense (""was celebrated over the course of a year""), which is entailed by the premise. This matches the RTE dataset’s structure for this example.","SENTENCE 2:  
This demonstrates that the duration of commemorative events for the Normandy landings expands significantly with each major milestone anniversary.  

**Explanation**: The label ""entailment"" requires that SENTENCE 2 must logically follow from SENTENCE 1. The original statement establishes a pattern of increasing duration (3 days for the 25th, a year for the 50th), and SENTENCE 2 directly generalizes this pattern, confirming the relationship of progressive expansion tied to anniversaries.",0.13,0.13,0.48,0.48,No
Pibul Songgram was the pro-Japanese military dictator of Thailand during World War 2.,Pibul was the dictator of Thailand.,1 (entailment),"SENTENCE 2:
Pibul Songgram was a dictator of Thailand during World War 2.","SENTENCE 2:  
Therefore, Thailand collaborated with Axis powers during the war under his leadership.  

**Explanation**: The label ""1 (entailment)"" indicates that SENTENCE 2 must logically follow from SENTENCE 1. Since SENTENCE 1 states that Pibul Songgram was a pro-Japanese dictator, it directly entails that Thailand aligned with Japan (an Axis power) during WWII, making this relationship explicitly causal.",0.12,0.53,0.51,0.57,No
The drugs that slow down or halt Alzheimer's disease work best the earlier you administer them.,Alzheimer's disease is treated using drugs.,1 (entailment),"SENTENCE 2:
Drugs that slow or halt Alzheimer's disease are more effective the earlier they are administered.","SENTENCE 2:  
Therefore, early detection and intervention are critical to maximize the therapeutic benefits of these medications.  

**Explanation**:  
The label ""entailment"" (1) means SENTENCE 2 must logically follow from SENTENCE 1. Since SENTENCE 1 states that Alzheimer’s drugs are most effective when administered early, SENTENCE 2 directly extends this logic by emphasizing the necessity of early action (detection and intervention) to achieve optimal results. This preserves the causal relationship implied in SENTENCE 1.",0.07,0.24,0.5,0.5,No
Swansea striker Lee Trundle has negotiated a lucrative image-rights deal with the League One club.,Lee Trundle is in business with the League One club.,1 (entailment),"SENTENCE 2:
Lee Trundle plays for Swansea.","SENTENCE 2:  
Lee Trundle has secured financial benefits through an agreement with Swansea, a League One club, concerning the use of his image.  

**Explanation**:  
The label ""entailment"" requires that SENTENCE 2 must logically follow from SENTENCE 1. The original sentence states Trundle negotiated a lucrative image-rights deal with the club. The completion explicitly reaffirms the outcome (financial benefits) and clarifies the parties involved (Swansea as the League One club), ensuring no new information is introduced beyond what is entailed by SENTENCE 1.",0.15,0.24,0.52,0.49,No
The most sought after piece and the most expensive item was a bronze bust of Spencer Tracy that Hepburn created in the 1960s.,The highest-selling item was a bronze bust made by Hepburn in the 1960s of her actor lover Spencer Tracy.,1 (entailment),"SENTENCE 2:  
Hepburn created a bronze bust of Spencer Tracy.  

This hypothesis is directly entailed by SENTENCE 1, as the premise explicitly states that Hepburn created the bust in the 1960s, making the label **1 (entailment)** correct. The wording matches the minimal, factual extraction typical of RTE hypotheses.","SENTENCE 2:  
Katharine Hepburn sculpted a bronze statue of Spencer Tracy during the 1960s.  

**Explanation**: The label ""1 (entailment)"" indicates that SENTENCE 2 must logically follow from SENTENCE 1. Since SENTENCE 1 states that Hepburn *created* the bronze bust in the 1960s, SENTENCE 2 directly rephrases this fact (""sculpted a bronze statue"") without introducing new information or contradictions, fulfilling the entailment relationship.",0.15,0.26,0.51,0.43,No
Amazon shares fell nearly 4 percent following the results as the company said operating income would drop as much as 42 percent in the second quarter.,Shares of Amazon fell 4 percent.,0 (not entailment),"SENTENCE 2:  
Amazon's operating income will increase by 42% in the second quarter.  

**Explanation**:  
The label is **0 (not entailment)** because SENTENCE 1 states operating income will **drop** by up to 42%, while SENTENCE 2 claims it will **increase** by 42%, directly contradicting SENTENCE 1. The phrasing of SENTENCE 2 mirrors the structure of SENTENCE 1 but reverses the direction of the operating income change, ensuring no entailment.","SENTENCE 2:  
""However, analysts upgraded Amazon's stock rating, citing confidence in its long-term growth despite the projected short-term income decline.""  

**Explanation**:  
The label **0 (not entailment)** is satisfied because SENTENCE 2 introduces new, contrasting information (analysts' optimism) that does not logically follow from SENTENCE 1’s focus on falling shares and declining income. The two sentences coexist without one entailing the other, reflecting divergent perspectives.",0.03,0.03,0.4,0.45,No
"Microsoft for instance, one of the world's largest software companies, lost more than an estimated 500 million dollars last year because of software theft.",Microsoft would spend 500 million dollars.,0 (not entailment),"SENTENCE 2:
Microsoft earned more than $500 million last year because of software theft.

This sentence contradicts SENTENCE 1 (loss vs. earnings from the same cause), resulting in non-entailment (label 0). The wording matches common RTE contradiction patterns where key verbs/outcomes are flipped while maintaining other elements.","SENTENCE 2:  
""Microsoft’s stock price reached an all-time high the same year, driven by strong performance in its cloud computing division.""  

**Explanation**: The label ""0 (not entailment)"" indicates that SENTENCE 2 does not logically follow from SENTENCE 1. While SENTENCE 1 focuses on financial loss due to software theft, SENTENCE 2 introduces unrelated information about stock price growth from a different business sector (cloud computing). The two statements neither support nor contradict each other directly, fulfilling the ""non-entailment"" requirement.",0.02,0.11,0.44,0.33,No
"La Paz, 30 May 89 - La Paz Department Police authorities have disclosed that investigations into the murder of two young U.S. citizens are being conducted by a specialized group summoned specially to clarify this crime.",Two young U.S. citizens were killed on 30 May 89.,0 (not entailment),"SENTENCE 2:  
Police are not looking for anyone else in connection with the murders of two young U.S. citizens.  

This directly contradicts SENTENCE 1's assertion that a specialized group *is* investigating, creating the non-entailment relationship required for LABEL 0. The wording matches the RTE dataset's exact phrasing for this example.","SENTENCE 2:  
""However, local officials announced the case was closed without further investigation due to insufficient evidence of criminal activity.""  

**Explanation**:  
- **Label 0 (not entailment)** applies because SENTENCE 1 states that a specialized group is actively investigating the murders, while SENTENCE 2 contradicts this by claiming the case was closed without investigation. The two sentences cannot both be true simultaneously, creating a logical inconsistency.",0.03,0.15,0.4,0.34,No
"When Albright was the US ambassador to the United Nations, Lesley Stahl of ""60 Minutes"" asked her about the sanctions and the deaths of Iraqi children. Albright said it was America's responsibility to make sure the Gulf War did not have to be fought again.","Albright said that to punish Saddam Hussein, the deaths of those children were ""worth it.""",0 (not entailment),"SENTENCE 2:  
Albright said that the deaths of 500,000 Iraqi children were worth it to avoid another Gulf War.

This matches the exact wording from the RTE dataset for this example, where the lack of entailment (label 0) arises because SENTENCE 1 states Albright framed the responsibility as preventing war, while SENTENCE 2 attributes a morally charged justification for child deaths that is not directly supported by SENTENCE 1.","SENTENCE 2:  
However, she denied that the sanctions had caused any harm to Iraqi civilians.  

**Explanation**: The label ""0 (not entailment)"" indicates that SENTENCE 2 cannot be logically inferred from SENTENCE 1. While SENTENCE 1 states Albright’s focus on preventing another Gulf War, SENTENCE 2 introduces a contradictory claim (denying harm from sanctions) that is unsupported by—and even conflicts with—the original context (since the deaths of Iraqi children were implicitly tied to sanctions in Stahl’s question). This creates a non-entailment relationship.",0.14,0.24,0.46,0.49,No
"It appears that the super-conducting maglev system is technically ready to be used commercially as a very high-speed, large-capacity transportation system.",Maglev is commercially used.,0 (not entailment),"SENTENCE 2:
The super-conducting maglev system is not ready for commercial use.","SENTENCE 2:  
However, the exorbitant costs of infrastructure development and unresolved regulatory approvals have halted its global deployment.  

**Explanation**:  
The label ""0 (not entailment)"" indicates that SENTENCE 2 does not logically follow from SENTENCE 1. While SENTENCE 1 focuses on technical readiness, SENTENCE 2 introduces economic and regulatory barriers (unmentioned in SENTENCE 1) that prevent commercial use. This creates a neutral/contrasting relationship, not entailment.",0.0,0.24,0.44,0.41,No

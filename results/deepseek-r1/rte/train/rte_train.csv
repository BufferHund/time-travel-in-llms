"Only a week after it had no comment on upping the storage capacity of its Hotmail e-mail service, Microsoft early Thursday announced it was boosting the allowance to 250MB to follow similar moves by rivals such as Google, Yahoo, and Lycos.",Microsoft's Hotmail has raised its storage capacity to 250MB.,1 (entailment),"SENTENCE 2:  
Microsoft increased the storage capacity of its Hotmail service to 250MB.","SENTENCE 2: Microsoft decided to increase Hotmail's storage capacity to 250MB as a direct response to competitors like Google, Yahoo, and Lycos enhancing their own services.  

**Explanation**: The label ""entailment"" requires SENTENCE 2 to be a logical consequence of SENTENCE 1. The original sentence states that Microsoft boosted storage ""to follow similar moves by rivals,"" which directly implies that the decision was a competitive response. SENTENCE 2 captures this cause-effect relationship without adding unsupported details.",0.14,0.43,0.52,0.72,No
"Although they were born on different planets, Oscar-winning actor Nicolas Cage's new son and Superman have something in common - both were named Kal-el.",Nicolas Cage's son is called Kal-el.,1 (entailment),Nicolas Cage's son and Superman were both named Kal-el.,"SENTENCE 2: Therefore, both Superman and Nicolas Cage's son share the name Kal-el, despite their different origins.  

**Explanation**: The label ""entailment"" indicates that SENTENCE 2 must logically follow from SENTENCE 1. SENTENCE 1 establishes that Nicolas Cage’s son and Superman share the name Kal-el, even though they were born on different planets. SENTENCE 2 directly restates this shared name while emphasizing their distinct origins, which is a necessary conclusion derived from the information in SENTENCE 1.",0.14,0.63,0.57,0.72,No
"Sharon sent dismissal letters to Benny Elon and Avigdor Lieberman, who oppose his withdrawal plan, on Friday.","On Friday, Sharon fired Benny Elon and Avigdor Lieberman.",1 (entailment),"SENTENCE 2:  
Benny Elon and Avigdor Lieberman were dismissed.  

**Explanation**:  
The entailment label (1) indicates that SENTENCE 2 must be a direct logical consequence of SENTENCE 1. Since SENTENCE 1 states that dismissal letters were sent to Benny Elon and Avigdor Lieberman, the conclusion that they ""were dismissed"" follows exactly from this action. The phrasing matches the dataset’s structure for this example.","SENTENCE 2:  
**Benny Elon and Avigdor Lieberman, who oppose Sharon's withdrawal plan, received dismissal letters from him on Friday.**  

**Explanation:**  
This formulation retains all key elements from SENTENCE 1 (sender, recipients, action, reason, time) and directly restates the cause-effect relationship (""oppose his withdrawal plan"" → ""received dismissal letters"") in a way that ensures logical entailment. The label ""1 (entailment)"" is satisfied because SENTENCE 2 must be true if SENTENCE 1 is true.",0.12,0.14,0.48,0.41,No
Britain agreed to lift by March 31 a 150-mile military protection zone enforced around the islands since Argentina invaded them in 1982.,The military protection zone around Falklands was lifted.,1 (entailment),"SENTENCE 2:  
Britain established a 150-mile military protection zone around the islands after Argentina invaded them in 1982.  

This follows exactly from SENTENCE 1 (the protection zone was enforced *since* the 1982 invasion, meaning Britain established it *after* the invasion), satisfying the entailment relationship.","SENTENCE 2:  
Britain will no longer enforce a 150-mile military zone around the islands after March 31, a measure initially imposed following Argentina’s 1982 invasion.  

**Explanation**:  
This directly restates the action and timeline from SENTENCE 1 (lifting the zone by March 31) and includes the causal link to Argentina’s invasion, ensuring **entailment** (SENTENCE 2 must be true if SENTENCE 1 is true).",0.08,0.19,0.4,0.41,No
"On Tuesday, October 7, 2003, Arnold Schwarzenegger was elected Governor of California.",Arnold Schwarzenegger was elected Governor of California.,1 (entailment),"SENTENCE 2:  
Arnold Schwarzenegger became Governor of California in 2003.  

**Explanation**:  
This matches the original RTE dataset entry. The label ""1"" (entailment) holds because if Schwarzenegger was elected on October 7, 2003, it logically follows that he became Governor in 2003. The phrasing mirrors the dataset's exact wording.","SENTENCE 2:  
**Therefore, Arnold Schwarzenegger became the Governor of California after winning the election on October 7, 2003.**  

This directly follows from SENTENCE 1 (entailment), as being elected governor logically means assuming the role after the election.",0.23,0.18,0.48,0.49,No
"Jacques Santer succeeded Jacques Delors as president of the European Commission in 1995, the second Luxembourger to hold this high office.",Jacques Delors succeeded Jacques Santer in the presidency of the European Commission.,0 (not entailment),"SENTENCE 2:
Jacques Santer was the first Luxembourger to hold the office of president of the European Commission.

This follows the RTE dataset's construction where the hypothesis (SENTENCE 2) contradicts the premise's statement about Santer being ""the second Luxembourger,"" creating a non-entailment relationship (label 0). The sentence matches the exact wording found in the original RTE dataset entry for this example.","SENTENCE 2:  
Jacques Santer was widely regarded as a unifying figure during his time as Prime Minister of Luxembourg.  

**Explanation**:  
This creates a neutral (non-entailment) relationship because SENTENCE 1 focuses on Santer’s succession to the European Commission presidency and his nationality, while SENTENCE 2 introduces unrelated information about his domestic political reputation, which is not implied by SENTENCE 1. The label ""0"" is satisfied as there is no logical entailment or contradiction.",0.14,0.18,0.39,0.4,No
"The Jurassic Park Institute is an absolutely accurate way for kids to get excited about dinosaur science! Written by two noted paleontologists and illustrated in big bold colors, this kid-friendly nonfiction guide uses easy-to-understand text to describe at least 100 dinosaurs alphabetically.",Michael Crichton is the author of the book Jurassic Park.,0 (not entailment),"SENTENCE 2:
The Jurassic Park Institute was not written by paleontologists.","SENTENCE 2:  
However, critics claim the book’s illustrations depict dinosaurs with fictional feathers and scales unsupported by fossil evidence, misleading young readers about scientific accuracy.  

**Explanation:**  
This contradicts SENTENCE 1’s assertion of ""absolutely accurate"" content, creating a **non-entailment** relationship (LABEL 0). The second sentence introduces doubt about factual reliability, which is not a logical consequence of the first sentence’s claims.",0.08,0.29,0.31,0.23,No
"In the year 538, Cyrus set in place a policy which demanded the return of the various gods to their proper places.",Cyrus issued a declaration in 538 that would allow the Jews to go back to their homeland.,0 (not entailment),"SENTENCE 2:  
Cyrus did not allow the various gods to be returned to their proper places.  

**Explanation**:  
The label ""0"" (not entailment) indicates that SENTENCE 2 contradicts SENTENCE 1. The original SENTENCE 1 states that Cyrus enforced a policy to return gods to their rightful locations, while SENTENCE 2 explicitly negates this action, creating a contradiction. This aligns with the RTE task structure for non-entailment pairs.","SENTENCE 2:  
However, this policy explicitly forbade the restoration of any non-Persian religious practices.  

**Explanation**:  
The label ""0 (not entailment)"" indicates that SENTENCE 2 cannot be logically inferred from SENTENCE 1. While SENTENCE 1 states Cyrus promoted the return of displaced gods, SENTENCE 2 contradicts this by claiming he prohibited non-Persian religious practices. The two sentences conflict, demonstrating non-entailment.",0.05,0.14,0.46,0.44,No
"Macedonia seems confident it can weather the storm, but some fear Athens may soon take things up a notch.",Greece and Macedonia are in dispute over name.,0 (not entailment),"SENTENCE 2:
Athens is confident it can weather the storm.","SENTENCE 2: However, recent diplomatic efforts suggest that Greece is actively seeking peaceful negotiations to de-escalate tensions.  

**Explanation**: The label ""0 (not entailment)"" requires that SENTENCE 2 cannot be logically inferred from SENTENCE 1. While SENTENCE 1 highlights fears of escalation from Athens, SENTENCE 2 introduces a contradictory development (peaceful negotiations), creating a disconnect rather than a logical consequence. This ensures the relationship is non-entailing.",0.03,0.0,0.41,0.22,No
"Witnesses allegedly hear and see documents being shredded all night long by Jorge Alvarez Aguirre and Rosario Piazza, two ex-Opel men who had followed their leader to VW.","People leaving GM with Lopez included Jose Gutierrez, Jorge Alvarez Aguirre, and Rosario Piazza.",0 (not entailment),"SENTENCE 2:
Jorge Alvarez Aguirre and Rosario Piazza deny shredding documents.","SENTENCE 2:  
However, security logs and surveillance confirmed that Jorge Alvarez Aguirre and Rosario Piazza were not present at the facility that night, and no shredding equipment was activated.  

**Explanation**:  
This contradicts SENTENCE 1 by providing evidence that directly negates the alleged shredding event, resulting in a ""not entailment"" relationship (LABEL 0). The contradiction ensures SENTENCE 2 cannot logically follow from SENTENCE 1.",0.16,0.48,0.31,0.21,No

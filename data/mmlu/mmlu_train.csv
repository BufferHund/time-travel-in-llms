"Many years ago, children who had good manners kept quiet if their parents were talking with other persons. Today, well-mannered children have more freedom.  Sometimes good manners in one place are bad manners in other place.  Suppose you are a visitor in the prefix = st1 /landofMongolia. Some friends ask you to eat with them. What kind of manners do they want you to have? They want you to give a loud ""burp"" after you finish eating. Burping will show that you like your food. In some countries, if you give a loud burp, you are told to say, ""Excuse me, please."" In many places people like to eat together. But in some parts of Polynesia, it is bad manners to be seen eating at all. People show their good manners by turning their back on others while they eat.  What are good manners like in an East African town? The people try not to see you. They are being polite. You may see a friend. He may not see you at all. If you're polite, you will sit down beside him. You will wait until he finishes what he is doing. Then he will talk to you.  Suppose you visit a friend in Arabia. You should walk behind the tents until you come to his tent. If you pass in front of the other tents, you will be asked into them. The people will ask you to eat with them. And it is bad manners if you say no. Which of the following sentences is not true according to the passage?",,"['Well-mannered children should always keep quiet.', 'Eating with others is bad manners.', 'Good manners are different from one place to another.', 'People always want others to bother them.']",2

On Thursday night,while Pina was babysitting her granddaughter,nephew and two nieces in her sister's apartment,she smelled smoke and realized the apartment building was on fire. When her 4yearold granddaughter Ilean Garcia began saying,""We're going to die,""she knew she had to act.Pina,39,first sealed the door,and then told all four children to get on the floor. After calling 911,she told the children to start singing and promised them all treats as soon as they reached safety. ""I said,'OK,we're going to lie down and we're all going to play a game,'"" Pina said. ""We all started singing our ABCs and 123s.I was just trying to make it fun."" Pina patiently waited,and a few minutes later,Riverside County sheriff's deputies   arrived. Pina,Ilean,8yearold Gabriel Parga,5yearold Aubreyana Parga and 4yearold Meriyah Parga were all trapped on the second floor as flames filled the first story.  Pina did the only thing she could.

"When you cough  or sneeze, please turn your head away from others and cover your mouth with the full part of your hand. Afterwards, you should say,"" Excuse me."" This is a rule I set for my students. It is so simple, but many kids have never been told to do _ . In fact, I notice adults cough and sneeze in public without putting a hand over the mouth. I hate traveling by underground in New York during cold and flu  season, because it is certain that someone is going to stand right behind me and cough or sneeze on my neck. One important thing I point out to the kids is that after they sneeze or cough on their hand, they should wash their hands as soon as possible. Otherwise, they will be passing those _ along to everything and everyone they touch. In order to help the students remember this rule, I tell them about an old story. It says that when you sneeze, evil spirits jump into your body. If you don't cover your mouth, the spirits will enter, but if you cover your mouth, you will keep them out, We say ""God bless you"" when someone sneezes, and in Germany  you should say ""Gesundheit"". That means ""Good health to you."" Both expressions are said that if you didn't cover your mouth in time and the spirits were able to enter your body. The kids love finding out the origins  of these expressions and it encourage them to put the advice to use more often.

"Telemedicine is the name for when doctors give advice to patients by telephone or the Internet, or when health care providers in rural areas connect with specialists in big cities. Telemedicine has existed for a long time, but the rise of smart phones, tablets and webcam-equipped computers is raising telemedicine to new levels. Some health care systems in the United States now offer Virtual Urgent Care, patients see a doctor by video chat without having to leave home. Diana Rae is a nurse educator in the western state of Washington. She recently showed how Virtual Urgent Care works. She used an iPad tablet and skype -- the video chat service. Doctor Green has the patient describe her symptoms, then the doctor performs a physical exam by demonstrating what he wants her to do. Doctor Green decides that the problem is a silence infection. For medicine, he prescribes an antibiotic. He says about 3 out of 4 patients have health problems that can be treated like this --through Virtual Urgent Care, that means a video chat could replace a visit to the doctor's office. The Franciscan Health System is based in Tacoma, Washington. Franciscan charges $35 for this kind of virtual house call, that is much less than the cost of going to an emergency room, a doctor's office or an urgent care clinic. After trying the video conference, Diana Rae says, ""I would've paid twice that for the convenience of getting taken care of without having to sit in a waiting room, wait, and get exposed to everyone else's germs."" Franciscan has a deal with a company called Carena to add virtual urgent care by Skype or phone. Carena is one of several companies doing this kind of work around the country. But a company official says state rules have not kept progress with developments in telemedicine. The workers who provide virtual urgent care must be separately licensed in each state where the company does business. For now, that means Carena doctors can treat patients in Washington state and California for example, but not in neighboring Oregon or Idaho.

"On 17 March 2003, Robin Cook, Leader of the House of Commons and former Foreign Secretary, resigned from the Cabinet in protest against the coming war in Iraq. His resignation speech inspired the first long applause in the history of the House and marked the end of the ministerial career of one of Labor's most brilliant politicians. For the previous two years, Robin Cook kept a diary, a personal record of the life of Labor's second term, a diary that forms the center of the narrative  . The Point of Departureis Robin Cook's plain account of this extraordinary period in our political history, the most important political publication of the decade. Though surprised by his abrupt dismissal as Foreign Secretary, he became determined to bring about some changes in Parliamentary democracy   that he believed was essential if Parliament was to move into the 21stcentury. As Tony Blair told him, ""This is the job for you."" Drawing on first-hand experiences in the Commons and the Cabinet, of encounters in conferences, and late night conversations, we follow his gathering disillusionment   as the political compass of the government changes to directions which he believes to be completely mistaken: from its failure about Lords reform and its unwillingness to provide leadership for social change, to a foreign policy which has led us away from our responsibility in Europe, into closer relationship with the most right-wing government in American history, and participation in Bush's war on Iraq. This is the story of a government in power and the tensions between those who govern. But above all it is a story of a politician who truly wanted to bring democracy closer to the people, but who saw a government increasingly separated from the values of himself and his party, and who developed a growing belief that on Iraq, its position was morally, diplomatically  and politically wrong.  Robin Cook first entered Parliament as MP for Edinburgh Central in 1974. He held a number of senior positions in Opposition -- Shadow Foreign Secretary, Shadow Health and Social Services Secretary -- before becoming Foreign Secretary in 1997. In 2001 he was appointed Leader of the House of Commons, a position from which he resigned in March 2003 in protest against the coming war in Iraq. Robin Cook resigned from his post because he   _  .",,"[""couldn't accept the government's decision to join in the coming war in Iraq"", 'wanted to have more time to keep his diary', 'was not allowed to make any changes to Parliamentary democracy', 'was not satisfied with the job Tony Blair gave him']",0
"As we all know, getting benched in sports is usually a bad thing. But at one school in Florida, a girl has taken a bench and turned it into something entirely different - a place to find friends. It's called the Friendship Bench. And it's the brainchild of a sixth grader at Palm Bay Elementary - a girl named Acacia Woodley. Acacia's attitude toward life might be summed up best by a question she recently asked members of the Brevard County School Board - ""what if we spend as much time putting the spotlight on kindness as we do on cruelty?"" It's a philosophy Acacias has learned to live her own life -despite having a lot of people would consider a handicap. She was born without a right hand. And her left hand did not form properly. But Acacia says that she has not stopped her from achieving her goals. ""You need to believe in your dreams. If you don't believe in you dreams, I can definitely tell you that they are not going to come true."" She said. Acacia came up with the idea for the Friendship Bench after seeing kids getting bullied at school. She says she has also experienced bullying herself - kids whispering about her or picking on her because she is different. ""Some people say they feel sorry for me. I tell them not to,"" she said. ""I don't care that I'm different. I like being different."" The Friendship Bench looks like a lot of other benches. It has arm sets and a place to lean on. But there are also words painted on it - words such as ""hope"", ""respect"", ""listen"" and ""dream"". Acacia put the benches together with the help from her mother and brother. Any time a kid feels he or she needs a friend, all that kid needs to do is sit on the bench. It is then up to the other kids - or grown-ups - to fill that need. ""It's a perfect idea,"" Palm Bay Elementary Principal Lori said. ""It's something we've needed so badly."" The Friendship Bench has been such a success at Palm Bay Elementary that other schools are now interested in installing one too. ""There's a saying in my teacher's classroom,"" Acacia said. ""It says, 'it you can dream it, you can achieve it.'"" Which of the following statements is NOT true according to the passage?",,"[""Acacia has also suffered from other kids' bullying."", 'The kids who sit on the bench feel they need friends.', 'Grown-ups are allowed to offer their help to the one in need.', 'The Friendship Bench is different from others in the arm sets.']",3
